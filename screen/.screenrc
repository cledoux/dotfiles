# # Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
# # A: The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate 
# text buffer is selected. The standard definitions of the termcap 
# initialize capabilities ti and te switch to and from the alternate text 
# buffer. (The scrollbar also does not work when you start e.g. ‘vi’). You 
# can tell screen not to use these initialisations by adding the line 
# “termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@” to your ~/.screenrc file.
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@
